      <p>Hospitals, medical clinics, and laboratories are the main  sources of biohazard medical, or <em>biomedical</em>,  wastes. This type of waste can be detrimental to the health and safety of  everyone. Local and federal law requires facilities to ensure the public does  not come into contact with biohazard waste.

			<h3>What is Biomedical Waste?</h3>
<p>Biomedical wastes can be solid, liquid, sharps, and laboratory waste that are potentially dangerous to humans and the environment. Healthcare facilities, medical research laboratories, funeral homes, and hospitals are the common producers of biomedical wastes.</p>
<p><a href="Medical-Waste-FAQ.php">See Medical Waste FAQ's</a></p>
<p>Does your facility produce any or all of the following?</p>
<p>Anatomical waste, dental amalgam, soiled waste, used gauze, gloves, cultures, swabs, bandages, infectious waste generated during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of humans and animals, waste produced during the creation or testing of biological agents, items stained in blood, human and animal excretions, body parts, tissues, and other infections body secretions.</p>
<p>If your answer is yes to any or all of the above, it means your business generates biomedical wastes. If your facility produces any such hazardous wastes, certain provincial and federal regulatory requirements may apply. Failure to comply with such regulations can lead to heavy penalties.
