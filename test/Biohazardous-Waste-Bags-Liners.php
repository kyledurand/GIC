      <p>Proper segregation and disposal of  biomedical wastes are required to protect the public and environment from  hazardous substances. You need durable waste bags and box liners that deliver worry-free  waste disposal management.

      <h3> Medical Waste Bags and  Liners</h3>

      <p>GICMD&rsquo;s medical waste bags and  liners are resilient and multi-purpose.<br>

        Use yellow bags for disposing the  following:                  

      <ul>

        <li>Bandages, Gauze, and Swabs</li>

        <li>Mild laboratory Wastes </li>

        <li>Biomedical Wastes</li>

        <li>Personal Protective Equipment  (PPEs)</li>

        <li>Plastic Tubing</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Use  yellow bags as a liner for medical waste containers. For discarding sharps  waste, ensure that sharps wastes aren&rsquo;t discarded inside the yellow bag.  Instead, throw out sharps waste inside the appropriate container then seal it.  Package the sharps waste container inside a yellow bag.<br>

        Use  red bags for disposing the following:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Cytotoxic Wastes  (generated from cancer therapy)</li>

        <li>Pathological Wastes</li>

      </ul>
