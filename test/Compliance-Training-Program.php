      <p>Handling of medical wastes must be done with caution. The  provincial and federal government establishes stringent rules and regulations  when it comes to management of medical wastes.

Count on GICMD to help you and your staff learn the correct  methodologies to take care of your facility&rsquo;s medical wastes. We will work  together with you to develop complete safety awareness among your medical staff  and employees.
