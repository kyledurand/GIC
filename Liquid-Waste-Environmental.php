			<h3>What is Wastewater?</h3>
<p>According to <em>Environment  Canada</em>, wastewater is the biggest source of surface water pollution in  Canada. It contains pollutants and substances that include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debris</li>
  <li>Grit</li>
  <li>Suspended solids</li>
  <li>Pathogens that cause diseases</li>
  <li>Decaying organic wastes</li>
  <li>Hazardous chemicals</li>
</ul>
<p>In Canada, most wastewater systems are handled and operated  by municipalities. The quality of wastewater and amount of pollutants released  to the environment vary across the country. All levels of government share  responsibilities in the collection, treatment, and release of wastewater. The  federal government is responsible for managing the risks brought by substances  outlined in the <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&n=D44ED61E-1">CEPA  1999</a>.</p>

      <p>Environment Canada describes wastewater as liquid waste  coming from two sources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sanitary  Sewage</strong> – generated from households, businesses, institutions, and  industries</li>
        <li><strong>Storm  water</strong> – generated from liquid drains coming from rooftops, lawns, parking  lots, roads, and other surfaces</li>
      </ul>
