      <p>GICMD has the answer to prevent occupational hazards from occurring  in your workplace. We have a wide selection of Personal Protective Equipment  (PPE) to protect the safety of your staff and clients. We also have an array of  Infection Control supplies to reduce the risks of illness and infections.
      <h3>Personal Protective Equipment</h3>
      <p>PPEs are your staff&rsquo;s first line of defence to protect  themselves from personal injuries. Ensure that they wear and use PPEs that  provide complete protection and comfort.<br>
        GICMD offers the following PPEs:
      <p><strong>Protective Eyewear</strong><br>
        Protective gears for the eyes, such as safety goggles and  face shields, will help prevent accidental eye injuries and ocular infections.  GICMD will help you choose the appropriate eyewear for the type of work done in  your facility. <br>
        <strong>Respirators</strong><br>
        Consult with GICMD experts to help you determine if  respirators are needed in your facility. We will also evaluate the type of  respirator required to protect your employees. <br>
        <strong>Face Masks</strong><br>
        Use protective face masks to prevent the spread of bacteria,  viruses, and other infectious substances from person to person. These PPE gears  also act as a shield against accidental liquid splashes or sprays.<br>
        <strong>Lab Coats or Cover  Gowns</strong><br>
        Lab Coats and cover gowns are your staff&rsquo;s and client&rsquo;s  armour against harmful pathogens. We&rsquo;ve got a wide selection of protective  clothing you can choose from to safeguard the health of everyone in your  facility. <br>
        <strong>Exam Gloves</strong><br>
        These PPEs provide you and your staff complete protection  against potentially infectious body fluids, blood, and hazardous substances.  Gloves are available in vinyl, latex, and nitrile. Our experts will assist you  in choosing the exam gloves that fit your needs and also comply with rules and  regulations.<br>
        <strong>Infection Control</strong><br>
        Infection Control is a systematic preventive measure that  should be in place, particularly in healthcare and medical facilities. <br>
        We offer the following infection control and medical facility  supplies:<br>
        <strong>Patient Gowns and  Robes</strong><br>
        The health and safety of your patients and clients are also  your top priority. Our patient gowns or robes provide your client the needed  protection, convenience, and comfort.<br>
        <strong>Exam Room Materials (e.g.  examination paper)</strong><br>
        Prevent the spread of germs by making sure that you dispose  exam room supplies after each use. Contact our GICMD sales representatives to  find out the correct materials your facility needs to promote infection  control.<br>
        <strong>First Aid Kits</strong><br>
        First Aid Kits are your first response to accidents and  injuries. Every facility must own a first aid kit for emergency purposes. <br>
        <strong>Hand Sanitizers</strong><br>
        As an alternative to constant hand washing, a hand sanitizer  helps prevent the risk of contamination. Protect the people that come in and  out of your facility by placing GICMD hand sanitizers at common or public  areas.<br>
        <strong>Disinfectant Liquid</strong><br>
        Keep every surface area in your facility properly cleaned  and disinfected to prevent transfer of bacteria or germs. We guarantee that our  effective disinfectant solutions have low toxicity but are powerful against  contaminants.
