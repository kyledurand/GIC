Consider the following when buying  waste containers:
      <ul>
        <li>The type of waste your  facility produces and needs to dispose</li>
        <li>Your allotted space or  area for waste bins and containers</li>

      </ul>
      <p>GICMD can provide you information and  training about proper biomedical waste segregation and disposal. Keep in mind  that different medical wastes should be correctly disposed. For example, a  medical laboratory will need a different type of waste disposal than a day  clinic. Sharps wastes should not be mixed with medical waste that can be  disposed in bags. </p>
      <p>Your facility might need an  assortment of medical waste containers to ensure safety and client satisfaction.  Remember, there is no such thing as being <em>too  safe</em>!</p>
