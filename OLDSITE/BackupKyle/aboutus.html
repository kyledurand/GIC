<p><strong>Industry History</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The biomedical waste disposal industry grew out of a need to contain and curtail the spread of infectious diseases by waste products emanating from healthcare services/industries and research facilities.   Biomedical waste disposal companies work in conjunction with the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) to mitigate the environmental and health related risks associated with biomedical waste.  As intermediaries, biomedical waste companies ensure industry compliance with MOE regulations and absorb the financial risks which once weighed heavily on healthcare practitioners.  As an adjunct to the enforcement efforts of MOE, biomedical waste disposal companies ensure the proper handling, treatment, storage, transport and disposal of waste.  Biomedical waste disposal companies therefore have a dual role to play in the medical waste industry; we support MOE efforts to contain and eliminate hazmat from the environment while providing an indispensible service to healthcare practitioners and research facilities. The hazardous waste disposal industry deals with sharps waste disposal, biomedical waste disposal, pharmaceutical waste disposal and chemical waste disposal.</p>
<p><strong>Company History</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>GIC Medical Disposal was established in 2009 in response to the growing need for a more competitive, flexible and customer-oriented hazardous waste company.  Doctors, nurses, and lab technicians expressed the need that the industry offered few options other than a long-term contract with inflexible service standards and empty promises.  Using feedback from healthcare practitioners, GIC Medical Disposal rose to the challenge by developing a four-pronged entry strategy that would cater to the unmet needs of the market.  This four-pronged strategy would form the basis of GIC&rsquo;s company mission and philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>The GIC Medical Disposal Four-Point Philosophy:</strong></p>
<p class="bullet">GIC is dedicated to providing its customers with hassle-free medical waste disposal services that reduce their environmental footprint.</p>
<p class="bullet">GIC coordinates with its clients to provide tailor-made services that afford complete flexibility and freedom.</p>
<p class="bullet">GIC employs a team of courteous experts who are competent in addressing the unique needs of medical practitioners.</p>
<p class="bullet">GIC is a full-service medical waste disposal service provider, and promises to provide its clients with the most competitive prices in the industry.</p>
