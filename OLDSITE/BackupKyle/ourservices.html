<p>GIC Medical Disposal is committed to proper toxic and hazardous chemical disposal as a means of reducing any contamination to the environment.

Traces of some chemicals have been detected, in varying levels, in aquatic species as well as in drinking water and vegetation.  While these levels are usually quite low, the cumulative and long-term impact of exposure raises serious concerns, and may have a severely detrimental effect on the environment and on human health.  The potentially adverse effects of chemical waste on our environment can be mitigated through GIC&rsquo;s strictly regulated chemical disposal services.</p>
